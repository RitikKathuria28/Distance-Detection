Human and Vehicle Distance Detection

YOLOv3 trained on COCO is used for person recognition and detection

Installation:
* Download the following files and place it in the same directory
   - https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/cfg/yolov3.cfg
   - https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights
* For slower CPUs, use yolov3-tiny 

The Threshold value = 0.5

The code can easily take an input as a video path or can use real time webcams by replacing the video_path to 0.
